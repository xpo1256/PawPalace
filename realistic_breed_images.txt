# Realistic Breed-Specific Image Mapping
# Each breed should have its correct matching image

# Current Issue: Images are not breed-specific
# Need to find proper breed-specific images for each breed

# Example of what we need:
# Pomeranian: Should show a fluffy, small, fox-like dog
# Golden Retriever: Should show a golden, medium-large dog with long hair
# Labrador: Should show a short-haired, medium-large dog
# German Shepherd: Should show a large, working dog with pointed ears
# French Bulldog: Should show a small, muscular dog with bat ears
# Bulldog: Should show a medium-sized, muscular dog with wrinkled face
# Poodle: Should show a curly-haired dog
# Beagle: Should show a small to medium hound with floppy ears
# Rottweiler: Should show a large, black and tan dog
# Siberian Husky: Should show a wolf-like dog with blue or brown eyes

# Current images are not breed-specific - need to find proper ones
